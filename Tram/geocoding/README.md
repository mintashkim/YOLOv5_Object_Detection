# Convert From Absolute Points to Relative Points

- Absolute Points(Latitude,Longitude)

- Realative Points(TM planar coordinates)

**Why?** Because Latitude and Longitude are the coordinates of the earth (tripartite), we have to coordinate it in three dimensions, but we don't know the altitude.

**SO** Requires two-dimensionalization to be displayed on a plane map & Convert to TM plan coordinates to reduce distortion

**And** As shown in the picture below, the starting point was replaced with (0,0) and the points were replaced with the points beyond.
